# PRODIGY_CS_03
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a
password based on criteria such as length,
ence of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and special characters.
Provide feedback to users on the
password's strength.
This Python code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for assessing the strength of passwords entered by the user. Here's a brief description of what the code does:.

****(Password Strength Assessment Function (assess_password_strength):****

This function takes a password string as input and assesses its strength based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, special characters, common words, and consecutive characters.
Each criterion contributes to a total score calculated based on predefined weights.
The function then categorizes the password strength based on the total score into levels such as "Highest," "High," "Medium," "Low," or "Lowest."

**(Assessment and Clearing Functions):**

assess_passwords: This function is called when the user clicks the "Check Passwords" button. It retrieves passwords entered by the user, assesses their strength using the assess_password_strength function, and displays the results in the output text area.
clear_text: This function is called when the user clicks the "Clear" button. It clears both the input and output text areas.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The GUI consists of a main window titled "Password Strength Assessment."
It includes a label prompting the user to enter passwords.
A scrollable text area allows users to input passwords.
Two buttons, "Check Passwords" and "Clear," trigger the respective functions.
Another label below the input area displays "Assessment Results."
A scrollable text area below the label displays the results of password assessments.
Overall, this code provides a user-friendly interface for evaluating the strength of multiple passwords simultaneously. Users can input passwords, assess their strengths, and clear the input and output areas as needed.
